# Push Notifications Implementation Note

Implementing true, real-time, server-sent push notifications (e.g., using Firebase Cloud Messaging, Web Push API with a service worker, or native mobile platform services) requires a dedicated backend infrastructure. This backend would be responsible for:

1.  Managing user device tokens.
2.  Storing notification preferences.
3.  Triggering notifications based on application events (e.g., new post created, event upcoming).
4.  Sending messages to the respective push notification gateways (FCM, APNS).

Since APSConnect currently utilizes `localStorage` for data persistence and operates primarily as a frontend application without a custom backend server for these specific functionalities, a full push notification system as typically understood is beyond the scope of changes that can be made solely within the frontend architecture.

## Possible Frontend-Only Alternatives (In-App Notifications)

If "push notifications" are desired within the app's current constraints, consider these simpler, frontend-based approaches:

*   **Polling/Periodic Checks**: The application could periodically check `localStorage` for new data (e.g., new posts or messages) and display an in-app notification badge or banner. This is not "push" but can simulate a notification experience.
*   **Event-Driven In-App Badges**: The existing "unseen posts count" on the Activity Feed link in the user dropdown is an example of an event-driven in-app notification. This could be expanded.

To implement a full server-based push notification system, significant backend development would be required.
